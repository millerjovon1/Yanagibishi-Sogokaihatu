       <h2>■Job Description and Requirements</h2>
         <p>Job Description:</p>
         <p>
         In addition to cooking and customer service, start by learning
         about shop management, including training part-time workers,
         sales management and proposing sales promotion plans!
         </p>
         <p>
         Academic qualifications, number of job changes or blank
         periods of career does not matter.
         Previous occupations and working experience does not
         matter either.
         There is a place where you can learn carefully from scratch.
         So please rest assured.
       </p>
       <p>
         The theme of management is BEST FOR YOU. To realise
         this, think by yourself, decide by yourself and do it yourself!
         We refer to our working staff as an associate.
         Associate means a valued colleague.
         The associates work together to come up with menus, shop
         decorations and events that reflect their work!
         If you're a person who can act spontaneously and make the
         shop a success, then this is the job for you.

       <p>Career Path and Development</p>
       <p>◆◇Wide range post-employment career options◇◆</p>
       <p>
         The time it takes to become a manager or head chef ranges from 6
         months to 1 year. Other promotions such as area manager and general
         manager are also possible. In addition, there are all kinds of career
         paths, including buyer/product development, marketer, starting up and
         incorporating new business, and secondment to other industries.
       </p>
       <p>◆◇Mastering skills to be independent.◆◇</p>
       <p>
         We support you to develop your skills to take on challenges without
         fear of failure. There is a human resource development training course
         called HRD, which allows you to utilise content that is useful for
         careers both inside and outside of food service, such as personal and
         management skill development. For those who want to become
         independent, this is an environment where you can gain a lot of
         experience.
       </p>
       <p>◆◇Can develop multiple perspectives and make progress◇◆</p>
       <p>
         In many companies, work is subdivided into various departments and it
         is not common to be involved in management or administration from the
         very beginning of your career. However, everyone in the food business
         that we develop works from multiple perspectives.
       </p>
       <br>
       <p>
         Another attraction of this job is the opportunity to learn and make
         progress in all elements of company management, including shop
         development, marketing, product development, cooking and sales.
         A number of people from overseas are already working for Yanagibashi
         Sogokaihatsu.We would like to show some of them.
         We hope that the following videos provide you a good clue about the
         Yanagibashi Sogokaihatsu.
