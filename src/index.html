       <p>Career Path and Development</p>
       <p>◆◇Wide range post-employment career options◇◆</p>
         The time it takes to become a manager or head chef ranges from 6
         months to 1 year.
         <br>
         Other promotions such as area manager and general
         manager are also possible.
         <br>
         In addition, there are all kinds of career
         paths, including buyer/product development, marketer, starting up and
         incorporating new business, and secondment to other industries.
         <br>
         <br>
      ◆◇Mastering skills to be independent.◆◇</p>
       <p>
         We support you to develop your skills to take on challenges without
         fear of failure.
         <br>
         There is a human resource development training course
         called HRD, which allows you to utilise content that is useful for
         careers both inside and outside of food service, such as personal and
         management skill development.
         <br>
         For those who want to become
         independent, this is an environment where you can gain a lot of
         experience.
         <br>
         <br>
       ◆◇Can develop multiple perspectives and make progress◇◆
       <br>
         In many companies, work is subdivided into various departments and it
         is not common to be involved in management or administration from the
         very beginning of your career.
         <br>
         However, everyone in the food business
         that we develop works from multiple perspectives.
         <br>
         <br>
         Another attraction of this job is the opportunity to learn and make
         progress in all elements of company management, including shop
         development, marketing, product development, cooking and sales.
